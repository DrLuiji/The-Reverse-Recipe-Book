Browse will launch the Browse Activity, which will consist of a list of food categories. Clicking
a category opens a new list of more specific food categories. Eventually, a single food item will
be chosen (e.g. Meat -> Red Meat -> Beef).

The food categories, sub-categories, and items are all loaded from a local database.

The options menu consists of one button, "Search". It allows the user to search for a food item
rather than browse for it. It features auto-complete.
