The main Reverse Recipe Activity consists of four tabs:

1. Recipe Search (see recipesearch.html)
2. My Pantry (see mypantry.html)
3. Favorites (see favorites.html)
4. Shopping List (see shoppinglist.html)

Upon launch, the activity will query our server. If an update to the item database or recipe
database exists, the user will be prompted for a download. (If declined, how should the user be
able to manually query for an update? i.e. where should the button go? Or should the user be
prompted every time?)
