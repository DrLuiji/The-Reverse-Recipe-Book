===================================================================================================
The main window for inputting food items to perform a reverse-recipe lookup. It is simply a list
of ingredients input. 

TODO: Behavior for long-pressing an item ("Add to My Pantry", among others)

The options menu consists of four buttons:
1. Add
2. Options
3. Clear
4. Go
===================================================================================================
Option: Add

This will prompt the user with a context menu with three choices:
a) Browse (see browse.html)
b) From My Pantry
c) Barcode Scan (see barcode.html)

The "From My Pantry" option simply switches the active tab to the My Pantry tab. From here, the
user may mark any items for inclusion into the current search by tapping them once.
===================================================================================================
Option: Options

This will launch a preferences page with the following options:

1. Match: "Any" or "All"
"Any" means the user wants to make a recipe featuring at least one input ingredient. "All" means
the user wants to make a recipe that includes every input ingredient. 

These two qualifiers only affect the ingredients input into the in-line reverse recipe search, and 
do not affect ingredients in "My Pantry" that have been implicitly added to the current search. 
Note that if "Any" is selected then it is impossible for the returned list of recipes to become 
smaller as more ingredients are added.

2. Match: "Recipes I Can Make" or "Recipes I Can't Make" 
Essentially, this is a way for the user to either browse recipes he can make right now, or recipes 
that he needs to go shopping for. These two qualifiers include items that are implicitly included 
by "My Pantry". 
===================================================================================================
Option: Clear

This will clear the current search. 
===================================================================================================
Option: Go

This will perform the search and launch the reverse-recipe results activity.
