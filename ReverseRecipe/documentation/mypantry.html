===================================================================================================
A list of all items the user has input to My Pantry. Each item will display its full name and
expiration date (will there be room?). On each list item there will be two buttons: an X, which
deletes the item from My Pantry (with confirm dialog), and a checkbox or other binary visual object
that indicates if the item has been explicitly added to the current recipe search. Note that even
items *not* added explicitly via THIS tab should still appear to have been (i.e. the user has
Carrots in his/her My Pantry, but elects to add Carrots to the current recipe search via Browse.
Then upon switching to My Pantry, the user will see Carrots highlighted, checked, or whatever).

TODO: Behavior for long-pressing an item.

The options menu consists of four buttons:

1. Add
2. Sort
3. Clear
4. Go

Probably, we will want an Options button as well (which would consume Sort).
===================================================================================================
Option: Add

This will prompt the user with a context menu with two choices:
a) Browse (see browse.html)
b) Barcode Scan (see barcode.html)

The "From My Pantry" option simply switches the active tab to the My Pantry tab. From here, the
user may mark any items for inclusion into the current search by tapping them once.
===================================================================================================
Option: Sort

This will either launch a context menu with sorting options, or simply cycle through them without
giving the user a choice. The latter is simpler, but more confusing to the user, and a large 
My Pantry will probably lag. If so, context menu it is.

The ingredients in My Pantry may be sorted alphabetically or by expiration date, and maybe also
by whether or not they are included in the current recipe search or not.
===================================================================================================
Option: Clear

If any My Pantry items have been explicitly added to the current search, this button will clear
them. Otherwise, it will delete the entire pantry (with confirm dialog).

(Is the first behavior necessary? Would the user ever want to clear all My Pantry items added to
the current search? Why?)
===================================================================================================
Option: Go

This will perform the search and launch the reverse-recipe results activity. It exists in this
activity as well as the Recipe Search activity because it is highly likely that the user would like
to construct a recipe using only ingredients from My Pantry and not have to Browse for or Scan any
new items.
