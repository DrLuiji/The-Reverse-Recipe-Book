"In-line" reverse recipe search: The user will be able to input a list of
ingredients from scratch. Then, the recipe database will be queried and recipes
featuring the input items will be displayed.

Ingredients are input via one of four ways:
	1. Explicitly added to the in-line search from "My Pantry" (i.e. My Pantry
		-> Canned -> Tuna)
	2. Selected via a cascading menu of large buttons representing broad
		categories of foods, i.e. Vegetables -> Carrots
	3. Typed with the keyboard and matched to an acceptable food category
	4. Barcode scanned

The latter two input methods require the input food item to be placed into a
broad category of food. For example, if the user enters "chili pepper sauce",
it should be automatically converted into "hot sauce".

In this activity, the user has the option of adding any food items input via
methods 2, 3, or 4 into My Pantry. (It is not necessary to do all My Pantry
updating via the My Pantry activity).

Various options:
* The user will have the ability to query the database incrementally, or after
all ingredients have been input. 

When performing incremental queries, the app will return a shrinking (or 
growing) list of recipes that match the user's input ingredients upon each
ingredient being added.     

Alternatively, the user may input a list of ingredients, hit "Go", and then
see a list of recipes, at which point he may refine his search.

* The user will have the option to implicitly include ingredients from "My 
Pantry" when performing an in-line recipe search.
** Should this be mandatory? The user may not want this if his pantry is out of
date, but he should just delete his pantry in that case. I can't think of
another scenario in which the user would want to disregard his pantry,
especially considering the following couple options.

* The user will have the option of matching "any" or "all" input ingredients.
"any" means the user wants to make a recipe featuring at least one input
ingredient. "all" means the user wants to make a recipe that includes every
input ingredient. These two qualifiers only affect the ingredients input into
the in-line reverse recipe search, and do not affect ingredients in "My Pantry"
that have been implicitly added to a "My Pantry" search. Note that if "any" is 
selected then it is impossible for the returned list of recipes to become 
smaller as more ingredients are added.

* The user will have the option of only matching recipes that he has all the
ingredients for, or matching recipes that include more ingredients than the
user has input. These two qualifiers include items that are implicitly included
by "My Pantry". Essentially, this is a way for the user to either browse
recipes he can make right now, or recipes that he needs to go shopping for.

Note the above two options do not represent the same concept. Some examples
highlighting the four permutations of the two options:
- The user wants to make a dinner (that night) with carrots and potatoes in it.
He adds carrots and potatoes to the in-line list of ingredients, either by 
explicitly adding them from his Pantry or inputting them manually. He implicitly
includes My Pantry, matches "all" input ingredients, and matches only recipes
that he has the ingredients for.

- The user wants to make onion soup later in the week. He adds onions and 
vegetable broth to the list of in-line ingredients, implicitly includes My
Pantry, matches "all" input ingredients, and matches only recipes that he has
the ingredients for. No results. He then matches recipes that he doesn't have
all of the ingredients before, and discovers a recipe for onion soup.

- The user wants to make a dinner (that night) with vegetables in it. He adds
carrots, broccoli, etc. to the list of in-line ingredients, implicitly includes
My Pantry, matches "any" input ingredients, and matches recipes that he has the
ingredients for. He discovers a recipe for broccoli and black DICK soup. (The
soup does not necessarily contain all of the vegetables he input).

- This last iteration is a little weird (match "any" input ingredients, only
show recipes that the user can't currently make). Let's say the user wants to
find a new way to make a meat dish. He adds chicken, beef, and fish to the list
of in-line ingredients, implicitly includes his pantry, matches "any", matches
only recipes that he doesn't have all of the ingredients for, and finds a
recipe for stuffed fish COCK.
